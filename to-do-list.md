# To-do List

Intital thoughts:

1. 





Sudhanva's to do
---

- start writing test cases for inputs and non-inputs
- personal recommendation is to use langchain + llama2 7b + transformers + chroma
- fine tune llama with transformers on HF on this data
- chroma will store your vectors, make them searchable with ranking
- langchain will pull from chroma and you have to build proper chain and connect to llama (most challenging part)
- ethics/illegal input considerations
- observability cosniderations
